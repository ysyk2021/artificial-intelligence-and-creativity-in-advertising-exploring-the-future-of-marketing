In this chapter, we will explore the creative applications of AI in advertising, specifically focusing on the use of voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces.

Background
----------

Voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces, such as chatbots, use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user input. By using AI to interpret and respond to speech, these technologies enable more interactive and engaging advertising experiences.

Voice-Activated Ads
-------------------

Voice-activated ads involve using AI-powered voice assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant, to interact with users and deliver advertising content. Voice-activated ads can be used in various formats, such as standalone ads, sponsored responses, and interactive skills.

One example of successful voice-activated ads is the "Burger King Whopper Detour" campaign, which encouraged users to download the Burger King app and order a Whopper from within 600 feet of a McDonald's location using voice-activated commands. The campaign was highly successful in generating buzz and engagement.

Conversational Interfaces
-------------------------

Conversational interfaces, such as chatbots, use AI to interpret user input and respond with relevant information or actions. Chatbots can be used in various advertising formats, such as customer service, product recommendations, and lead generation.

One example of successful conversational interfaces is the "Sephora Virtual Artist" chatbot, which uses AI to help users find the right makeup products by analyzing photos of their face and offering personalized recommendations. The chatbot has been highly successful in generating sales and improving the customer experience.

Benefits
--------

There are several benefits to using voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces in advertising, including:

* Interactive experiences: Voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces enable more interactive and engaging advertising experiences, which can generate buzz and excitement.
* Personalization: AI-powered technologies can analyze user data and offer personalized recommendations or responses, creating a more tailored experience for each user.
* 24/7 availability: Voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces can operate 24/7, allowing users to interact with advertising content at any time.

Challenges
----------

There are also challenges associated with using voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces in advertising, including:

* Technical limitations: Voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces require significant technical resources and expertise to create and maintain, which can be costly and time-consuming.
* Privacy concerns: Users may be hesitant to share personal information with AI-powered technologies, raising privacy concerns that must be addressed by advertisers.

Conclusion
----------

Voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces represent an exciting opportunity for creating interactive and personalized advertising experiences. By using AI to interpret and respond to user input, these technologies can generate buzz and excitement while providing tailored content and recommendations. However, advertisers must be aware of the challenges associated with implementing these technologies and be prepared to invest significant resources to create successful campaigns. Overall, voice-activated ads and conversational interfaces are promising creative applications of AI in advertising.
